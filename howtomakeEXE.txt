To make the `gui.py` file executable, you can create an executable script or binary from it using a tool like `pyinstaller`. Here's how you can do it:

1. Install `pyinstaller` (if you haven't already):

   You can install `pyinstaller` using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory where your `gui.py` file is located using the terminal.

3. Use `pyinstaller` to create an executable:

   Run the following command to create an executable binary from your `gui.py` script:

   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile gui.py
   ```

   This command will generate a `dist` directory within your project folder, and inside it, you'll find an executable file named `gui`.

4. Run the executable:

   You can now run the executable directly, and it will launch your GUI application:

   On Windows:
   ```bash
   .\dist\gui.exe
   ```

   On macOS or Linux:
   ```bash
   ./dist/gui
   ```

Your `gui.py` script is now bundled into an executable that can be easily distributed and run on compatible systems.
